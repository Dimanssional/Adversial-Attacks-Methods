# Adversial-Attacks Methods implementation

<p align="justify">This project represent impact of white-box adversarial attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks. Chosen algortims are Fast-Gradient Sign Methods, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack, Basic Iterative Method and Iterative Least-Likely Class Method.</p>

<p align="justify">Several models of Convolutional Neural Networks have been developed. First model have been trained on MNIST dataset. Second model have been trained on CIFAR-10 dataset. Accuracy of  first model is 98.56%. Accuracy of second model is 86.91%.</p>

<p align="justify">Classes FGSM, JSMA, BIM, ILLCM implement interface AdversarialAttack and represent aforementioned adversarial algoritms.</p>
